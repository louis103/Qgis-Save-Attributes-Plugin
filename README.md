Plugins in QGIS are stored in a special folder. We must copy our plugin directory to that folder before it can be used. In QGIS, locate your current profile folder by going to Settings â€£ User Profiles â€£ Open Active Profile Folder.

In the profile folder, copy the plugin folder(save_attributes) to python â€£ plugins subfolder.

Now we are ready to have a first look at the brand new plugin we created. Close QGIS and launch it again. Go to Plugins â€£ Manage and Install plugins and enable the Save Attributes plugin in the Installed tab.

You will notice that there is a new icon in the plugin toolbar and a new menu entry under Vector â€£ Save Attributes â€£ Save Attributes as CSV`. Select it to launch the plugin dialog.

Make sure on your Qgis left panel you have loaded some vector files.
Select a vector file from the plugin dropdown menu and select an output directory,click Ok and wait as your CSV file is generated.
